## My Private R Archive Network (PRAN)

Welcome to my personal R package repository! Here, you will find a collection of R packages that are compiled and made available for installation for Windows and macOS

- [idps](https://github.com/ahmathlete/idps)
- [MeteoMate](https://github.com/ahmathlete/MeteoMate)
- [rWRF](https://github.com/ahmathlete/rWRF)
- [KlimaKonformC3](https://github.com/ahmathlete/KlimaKonformC3)

```{r}
install.packages("pkg-name", repos = "https://ahmathlete.github.io/PRAN")
```

Note that you should replace pkg-name with the actual name of the package you wish to install.

## Package Compilation

All of the packages are compiled and made available for installation via 
this repository. The compilation process is automatically generated using Github
Actions, which are configured in the repository's workflows.

## Contact
